1rrr0001 = Write register r to 16bit memory address
1rrr0000 IIII = load immediate to register r

0x15 / 0x11, 1 byte signed conditional branches. Probably eight of them from 0x10 to 0x17

0x09, return?


0x7a NN NN = syscall
0x7b NN = 1 byte relative call
0x7d = call register R1 (put return address in R1?)

0xb1 = unconditional branch to regsiter r1
