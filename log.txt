## Day 1:

The information from Key about the system was an extremely useful starting point.

The first things I took note of was:

 * the program counter and address space is 16bit.
 * general memory is in the range 0x0100 to 0xefff
 * IO devices are in the range 0xf000 to 0xffff

I started with throwing DIAG_F1 in a hex editor and immediately noticed lots of things that looked
suspicious like IO addresses. There were sections of the dump where the repeating patterns of

    A1 Fn nn

stood out like a sore thumb. This gives out us our first candidate instruction:

    0b10100001 NNNN - Do something with memory NNNN

Because there instruction butt right up next to each other ie:

    76
    3a
    a1 f1 09
    a1 f1 0b
    a1 f1 0d
    a1 f1 0f
    81 f1 10
    c0 0f
    42 31

We can make the assumption that this is an instruction that operate directly on memory (instead of
loading the address into an index register, and a second instruction using the index register to do
the actual memory op.
It's also likely a write.

At this point I decided to look at the bootstrap ROM, because Ken Romaine gave a lot of useful
information about it's function in his comment on the video part 7.

My bootstrap takeaways:
  * the bootstrap is the PROM sitting on the backplane (bit of a weird place)
  * It lives at address 0xfc00
  * It's job is to interact with:
    * the first MUX board (at 0xf200) for a minimal serial terminal user interface on mux port 0
    * The buttons/switches on the front panel
    * the hawk disk controller at ~0xf140-0xf14f

  * Depending on the buttons/switches, it load an IPL off the selected disk
    * Sectors 0 to F are loaded to 0x0100
    * Will loop doing RTZ and retrying if there is a failure

This detailed information, plus bootstrap's small size and constrained scope, it is an ideal candidate
for ISA reversing.

So I throw BPN-TBP18S42N into a hex editor and quickly find the 0xf2nn and 0xf14n addresses that I'm expecting.

At this point, I dump it out to a text file and start splitting up bytes that look like instructions
onto their own line, and adding comments.
Due to some weirdness,  I decide that this bootstrap ROM is backwards comapred to the DIAG rom and reverse it
with a small python program. Things start to make significantly more sense.

Some of the memory instructions are using opcodes other than A1. 81, 91 and b1 are seen.
Ken Romaine's docs say there are 16 interrupt banks of 8 registers (each 16 bit), and that all
memory writes are 8 bit, so lets assume there will be 3 bits dedicated to selected which register
is written to memory and our assumed instruction to:

    0b1rrr0001 NNNN - Write 8bits of register R to absolute memory address NNNN

At this point, I'm also making the assumption that execution starts at the start of bootstrap (0xfc00)
because I haven't seen anything looking like a reset vector, and the start of both bootstrap and
DIAG_F1 look kind of like initialization code (setting MMIO registers to known values)

Splitting the bytes in bootstrap up into assumed instructions produces some candidates for one, two
and three byte instructions, but I kind of stall out on progress. At this stage of ISA Reversing,
I'm really looking for control flow instructions along of:

  * relative conditional branches
  * relative unconditional branches
  * absolute jumps
  * absolute calls
  * returns

Finding and understanding these will give us a good idea of program control flow, and give us more
clues about where the variable length instructions start.

So, I started looking at the DIAG_F2, DIAG_F3 and DIAG_F4 roms. The good thing about these roms is
that they have lots of ASCII strings. Especially F3 and F4, so I'll focus on those.

What they don't have is an entry point. Bootstrap and F1 both look like they might start execution
at 0x0000, but at 0x0000, F2/F3/F4 have a list test entries, with a 16 bit address, followed by a
null-terminated ascii string. The list is terminated by a 16 bit null value.

The 16 bit values are all in the range 0x0040 to 0x0700, and these are 0x800 byte roms, so we can make
some assumptions.

 * Execution on the DIAG board starts on the F1 chip.
 * It initializes the serial terminal, enumerates one or more of the other roms and prints out a
 * numbered list of tests for the user to select.
 * When the user selects a test, F1 transfers control to `rom base address + address entry point`
 * There are also other modes to select tests via dip switches and get output via leds.

With these assumptions we get series of entry points, one per test. And we can start looking for
similarities and differences in the function body.

Notably, the last test right at the end of each F2/F3/F4 is a ROM self test (presumably a checksum)
We have 3 versions of it, so we can compare differences.

#### Function calls

The other thing that stands out is F3 and F4 each contain a section of common code before the first
test's entry point, which is going to give us a good clue about how function calls stand out.

the first instruction that stood out as being call, was 90 NN NN. However, we already have evidence
to suggest this is actually a load immediate instrction.

In F3/F4, the next bytes after 90 NN NN (where NNNN looks like a function address) are always 50 80
and the byte after that is commonly B1 or 7d.

This hints that the call pattern these roms are using is something like:

    90 NN NN ; R1 = 0xNNNN
    50 80 ; PC = R1 + Rb; Rl = NextPC

    Where Rb is the base address of this rom, set by the F1 ROM before transferring execution
    and Rl is the register where the return address is stored.

or more likely

    90 NN NN ; R1 = 0xNNNN
    50 80 ; R1 = R1 + Rb
    7d ; PC = R1, Rl = Next PC

    Rl is probably R1

    and these are tail calls

    90 NN NN ; R1 = 0xNNNN
    50 80 ; R1 = R1 + Rb
    b1 ; PC = R1 AKA, branch to register

It seems the return instruction is 09 (which might actually be branch to register R1)

It seems the F3/F4 roms are using this call pattern because they don't know their own base address
Prephaps the code was written with the assumption that you could put these chips in any ROM socket
of the diag board, and they would work at whatever hard-coded address they ended up at.

Bootstrap, F1 and F2 don't use this function call pattern.

#### ROM self test (relative branches)

The F3 and F4 rom tests are almost identical. The only differences are:

The address of the single function they call.
A load immediate instrction which matches the length of the data in this rom.

This function is quite short, and probally functions by looping from Rb + 0 to Rb + RomEnd, adding or
xoring all bytes. The last non-zero byte in each rom is different, and is probably set to whatever
results in the loop producing zero.

The self test function in F2 is slightly different. It doesn't call out to a common function and
it directly pokes the MUX registers to output data to the serial terminal. F3/F4 seem to use what
looks like a syscall to do this (which we will cover later)

These 3 versions of the rom test are perfect to work out relative branch instruction.

this is my understanding of the F3/F4 self test at this point:

    55 86
    3a
    85 61
    40 10
    d0 07 96 ; r5 = 0x796 ; address of last byte of data in this rom
    50 82
    51 62
    15 f3
    8b 41 01
    15 18
    7a 01 12 ; print syscall
    "\n\r*** PASS ***\0" ; Null terminate string embedded in program control flow
                        ; The print syscall consumes it and resumed execution afterwards.

    a1 f1 0a ; r2 -> [0xf10a] (mux regsiter?)
    72 01 0e ; exit syscall?


    7a 01 12 ; print sycall
    "*** FAIL ***\0"

    a1 f1 0b ; r2 -> [0xf10b] (mux regsiter?)
    a1 f1 0c ; r2 -> [0xf10c] (mux regsiter?)
    72 01 0e ; exit syscall

We want to find at least two branches. Backwards branches are easier to spot, as they use negative
numbers. We want a small negative number, so an instruction with operand like 0xf0 would be perfect.

The best candidate is 15 f3, which would be branch -13 bytes. We can also see a second 15 instrction, 15 18
which is a good candidate for a positive 24 byte skipping over the pass branch to the fail code.

We can insert lables and extrapolate to get

    55 86
    3a

checksum_loop:
    85 61
    40 10
    d0 07 96 ; r5 = 0x796 ; address of last byte of data in this rom
    50 82
    51 62
    15 f3 ; conditional branch to checksum_loop
    8b 41 01 ; this somehow sets the flags for the following branch
    15 18 ; conditional branch to checksum_fail

checksum_pass:
    7a 01 12 ; print syscall
    "\n\r*** PASS ***\0" ; Null terminate string embedded in program control flow
                        ; The print syscall consumes it and resumed execution afterwards.

    a1 f1 0a ; r2 -> [0xf10a] (mux regsiter?)
    72 01 0e ; exit syscall?

checksum_fail:
    7a 01 12 ; print sycall
    "*** FAIL ***\0"

    a1 f1 0b ; r2 -> [0xf10b] (mux regsiter?)
    a1 f1 0c ; r2 -> [0xf10c] (mux regsiter?)
    72 01 0e ; exit syscall

It is likely there are more version of the conditional branch instruction. Cross checking

The F2 version of checksum is then useful for finding more types of relative branches

Instead of using syscalls, it has it's own loop for writing bytes to the serial terminal.

It still embeds strings like above, but instead abuses the relative call instructions to record the string
address and jump to the send loop, which allows us to discover the relative call instruction.

    7B NN

#### syscalls pattern

The F3 and F4 roms use what look like syscalls. It is not currently known where these syscalls are
implemented, or even if these are actually syscalls, and not just a "call register" instruction.

But they probally point somewhere in the F1 rom. The syscall pattern

    7a 01 NN
    <0 or more bytes of Call data>

where NN are typically even numbers in the range 0x0 to 0x20

The exit syscall uses a opcode 72 instead.

Known syscalls:

    7a 01 12 - print to stdout, takes null terminated string.
    7a 01 02 - block until keypress, takes no arguments (probally returns the input char too)
    72 01 0e - exit syscall

## Day two:

First, I wrote up these logs so there is a record of the steps I took.

Next, I'm planning to write a hacky disassembler in python. Now that we have an idea about relative
branch instructions, an automated tool starts to become useful

...

Ok, variable length instructions make this a lot harder. I have a disassembler, it's flexible, it
can follow branches. But I'm not really liking the instructions I have programmed into it.

I'm reasonably happy about control flow instructions, but suspicious about my 16bit store instruction.
And I really need to find ALU instructions.

## Day three:

Big info dump from Ken here: https://discord.com/channels/768194223576842281/953305332912893973/954796823908843602

Which points out something I've been ignoring. This serial interface doesn't have a FIFO, and it's
reasonably slow. So our serial write code needs to poll the status register to make sure the previous
byte is sent before sending the next byte.

And the my current assumptions haven't found a read instruction, my listings have writes to both
f200 and f201 in serial send code.

So out with our previous write instruction 1rrr0001. It might actually be 10100rrr, but I'm getting
a feeling these memory instructions might not be fully orthogonal.

So for now we will assume:

  a1 - 10100001 NN NN is write some register to NNNN
  81 - 10000001 NN NN is read NNNN to some register


With those new assumptions, we can take a look at F2's send byte function and get:

    send_string:
    wait_status:
        81 f2 00 ; ld r? f200
        ; These two instructions somehow mask off unwanted status bits,
        ; or otherwise prepare status for the conditional branch
        2c ; might be shr r?
        2c ; might be shr r?
        11 f9 ; b?? conditional branch wait_status

        85 41 ; something like ld r1, [r?++]. Sets flags
        15 01 ; bnz send_byte
        09 ; ret
    send_byte:
        a1 f2 01 ; st r?, 0xf201
        73 ef ; unconditional branch send_string

The fact that 85 41 is a two byte instruction, kind of messes up any hope that the load/store
instructions are orthogonal. There isn't really a sane way to make the 81 instruction select
between 7 registers without conflicting with the encoding of this 85 instruction.

#### Diag memory map

Nakazoto has been beeping out the Diag board, and he finally got it far enough that I think I can see
how it maps the ROMs and it's IO into the memory map.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953305332912893973/954946213038411916/Diag_Schema_-_Schematic.png

The A, B and C lines of the two 74LS138 chips are feed directly from the backplane (via bus transceivers).
Chances are these lines are A11, A12, A13. The outputs of the 74LS138s control 13 rom sockets (each
with a 0x800 or 2KB rom), plus a 14th slot where the IO lives.

This indicates that all ROMs are mapped into the memory map sequentially, and that these is no bank
switching (though, we would need to know how the 138s are enabled to be sure)

If we assume this rom board maps in at 0x8000, then 0x8000 + 14 * 0x800 is 0xf000, which happens to
be the start of IO.
Essentially, this Diag board has been designed with the maximum number of ROM sockets that it could
have if mapped them sequentially starting from 0x8000.

It's probally mapped at 0x8000, because this takes up a full 0x7000 bytes of memory, and it doesn't
look like there is enough logic to map it anywhere other than 0x0000 or 0x8000. And if it was mapped
at 0x0000, then it would conflict with the registers which are mapped from 0x0000 to 0x0100.
Besides, 0x8000 is a classic place to map ROMs in this era of computing.

--------------


At this point I coincidentally started looking at bootstrap again, trying to make the dissembler output
of the entry point look sane.

The second instruction in was a relative jump that skipped over 3 bytes, and the first instrction
kind of looked like a conditional branch, but with a 1a code that I wasn't sure was a branch.

But when I set it up in my dissembler, I immediately noticed that it jumped into those 3 skipped bytes
and those 3 skipped bytes (71 80 81) looked like they might be an absolute jump to 0x8001.

when implemented, I got this output for the bootstrap entry point"

    fc00:    1a 02              b? (10) L0
    fc02:    73 03              jump L2

    L0:
    fc04:    71 80 01           jump 0x8001 L1

    L2:
    fc07:    80 c5              li r0, 0xc5
    fc09:    a1 f2 00           st r0, 0xf200
    fc0c:    80 8c              li r0, 0x8c
    fc0e:    a1 f2 01           st r0, 0xf201
    fc11:    0e                 unknown
    fc12:    0e                 unknown
    fc13:    90 10 00           90 r1, 0x1000
    fc16:    5f                 unknown
    fc17:    7b 79              call L3
    fc19:    c4                 unknown
    fc1a:    bd                 unknown
    fc1b:    00                 unknown
    fc1c:    7b 72              call L19
    fc1e:    c0                 unknown
    fc1f:    c6                 unknown
    fc20:    71 fc 00           jump 0xfc00 L20


We can see that this code at the start of bootstrap checks some condition, and if it's true, it jumps
to address 0x8001, which is the second byte into F1, if our Diag memory map from above it correct.
(and the first byte of F1 is empty, so it fits)

Otherwise it calls some functions that try to boot off the disk drive and if they fail, it loops,
checking if it should branch to diag or retry booting off disk.


this unknown conditional branch is weird, there is no compare instruction. I'm guessing it might be
a branch instruction that is feed directly from an external an IO line, kind of like the 6502's
set-overflow pin, which can be used to control the branch direction of a conditional branch from
outside the cpu.

If so, It would theoretically be wired to some signal on the backplane, which the Diag board would
assert when plugged in (potentially controlled by a dip switch, or it's button?)


#### Death of the syscalls

I so wanted syscalls to be a thing. They probally still are, but Diag doesn't use them.

Turns out the thing I and assumed was a syscall was simply the indirect call instruction.
Takes a 16bit address, reads a 16bit value from that address and calls it.
each test in F3/F4 calls a function in F3/F4 that calculates the absolute function pointers
and writes them to the table at memory starting from 0x0102. 0x0100 is probally written by F1
as a way of returning control to F1 after the test.

Good news is that the init function gives us the second instruction we know for sure that is
writing to memory, B1 NN NN

Chances are A1 is write r0 to NNNN, and B1 is write r1 to NNNN

--------------

Oh, I'm stupid. This is a 16 bit write instruction. It needs to be 16bit for this Init function to
make sense.

I'm now coming to the conclusion that this CPU has a very strong sense of an Accumulator, with
large numbers of instructions directly operating on it.

So new assumptions:

    80 NN - load 8bit immediate into A
    90 NN NN - load 16bit immediate into A
    81 NN NN - read 8 bits from memory into A
    91 NN NN - read 16 bits from memory into A
    A1 NN NN - write 8 bits of A to [NNNN]
    B1 NN NN - write 16 bits of A to [NNNN]

---------------

Knowing how the function calls in the F3/F4 roms work, I set about making wrapper disassembler scripts
for them.

These scripts allow me to manually specify things (function names, entry points, comments) for the
disassembler to add to the output during each run.

**F3 and F4 share a lot of common code.**

#### CPU instruction tests.

Perhaps I spent too long ignoring the F2 rom. This was mostly because it was different from F3/F4.
But the strings indicate it has a CPU instruction test, so I really should take a look at it.

We need a wrapper script for it, and since scan_strings doesn't work for it, I deicide to manually
enter the strings.

One of the first things I notice is that the 7d instruction actually takes a one byte argument
(not sure if signed or unsigned), though in the common, ldw A, fn_address; add_base_address, 7d
pattern, it's always zero.

Then looking at the instruction tests themselves, they start off with a strong pattern of
 unconditional branch + 1, followed by a 00 opcode.

This strongly suggest that 00 is halt.
It could also theoretically be a software interrupt, but I don't see any sign of an interrupt
handler that prints out information about the failed test. Probally the technician was supposed to
operate this instruction test by watching the front panel. If the run light stays on, the cpu is good.
If the halt light comes on, then the cpu test is a fail. The address LEDs will then actually tell
you the address where the instruction test failed, which can be used to further diagnose the problem.

Are field technicians expected to repair CPU boards in the field? chances are they get swapped out and
sent back to the main company for repair by an expert.

The two most useful part of the tests for today was:

 * the tests of all conditional branch instructions (except for the sense switch instructions)
 * the instruction length tests.

 I managed to stub in a good chunk of multi-byte instruction.

## Unscrambling the bootstrap rom.

We are already assuming the bootstrap rom's address lines are inverted (which means the dump needs
to be reversed) but things still don't quite make sense.

There are long stretches that do make sense. The code at the start looks right, we have the
"\r\nERROR\r\n" string. We have most of the WriteString code from Diag_F2, but it goes off the rails
near the end. Instead of writing the char to 0xf201, it writes the char to 0xf273.

Looking at where it goes wrong, it's on a 32 byte boundary. So something is probally wrong with
address line A5.

Looking at the rom in a hex editor, I manage to spot the code sections I expect both before and after
my WriteString code block.

At this point my brain power is running out, and I sit here trying random permutations of address
lines trying to get the right answer for over an hour.

I eventually get the right answer:

    BUS A8 is wired to ROM A5
    BUS A5 is wired to ROM A6
    BUS A6 is wired to ROM A7
    BUS A7 is wired to ROM A8

And we get a bootrom disassembly that makes a lot more sense. Notably, WriteString is called for
both the "D=" prompt during init, and for the ERROR text.

Still don't have the complete control flow, I had to add a bunch of extra entry points.
But getting closer.

---------------------

Lol, this cpu has an instruction that takes an 8bit signed offset, loads a 16bit address from
pc+offset, then loads an 8bit value from that address.
And the programmer of the bootstrap ROM is using it to save one byte each time a MMIO register is
referenced twice within a short range. They pointed right at the operand of the first MMIO access
instrction.
A total of 4 bytes saved.

classic 70s CISC machines

## Day 3

Ken showed up and named a few instructions I didn't already know about. NOP and Delay, which delays
execution for 4.5ms

Spent some time disassembling F1, It's where I expect to find the TOS operating system, along with
the code to launch the tests.

Found a new absolute call instruction.

Also improved bootstrap slightly.

-----------------

Next, we really need a Rosetta stone to decode the ALU instructions.

First, I'm going to take a look at the rom checksums and see if I can work out the algorithm.
if I can implement in python, maybe I can line it up. I'm expected either an XOR or ADD all bytes
style algorithm

(got distracted commenting bootcode, discovered the "mov SP, A" instruction)

....

Worked out the checksum. Sum all bytes except the last non-zero byte. The result should match
the last byte in the ROM.

The algorithm works with both 8bit overflow or 16 bit overflow and only comparing the low byte.
Which means we don't get any insight into the width of the operations, but it's a start.

------------------

I'm having a hard time making this checksum function work with my current assumptions,
even knowing more or less what algorithm it's implementing.

So lets experiment with a fresh assumption:
    What if this machine two Accumulators. An A Accumulator and a B Accumulator?
    What if for most instructions that operate on A, there is a version that operates on B?

There are two instructions, C0 NN and D0 NN NN instructions show up often, and I've flipped back and
forwards between them being "Compare A with Byte/Word Immediate" or "Subtract Byte/Word Immediate from A"
many times. One meaning would fit better in one place, and the other would fit better in the other.
But neither really worked well, and wouldn't work at all in other places.

But these are natural candidates for "Load Byte/Word Immediate into B"

....

While looking around after applying these changes, I happen to spot this function in F3/F4:

90ef:    c0 07        lib B, 0x07
90f1:    40 31        unknown

L2:
90f3:    7b ae        call WriteByte
90f5:    09           ret 9

Which does some math on it's input, and calls WriteByte one or two times.
WriteByte takes Ascii, so the 0xb0 and 0xb9 constants stick out as the
characters '0' and '9'

(This would be a lot easier to spot, if this machine used ASCII with bit 7 cleared)

And when we check where this function is called we see it's used something like:

    WriteString("*** ERROR, ADDR=");
    95 a1 ; unknown instruction
    39 ; unknown instruction
    Fn_0C5();
    WriteString(" ***\0");

(code simplified)

I went though a few options (WriteInteger, WriteBCD) before deciding that this
is WriteHexByte

This allows us to make some more progress.

    a5 a2      pushes a byte to the stack
    42 31      is A = A & B
    2c         is probably rotate right
               (if it was shift right, this function would just four of them)
    49         is compare A with B (subtract B from A and discard result)
    19 04      is branch less than

    85 a1      pops a byte off the stack

And the corresponding WriteHexWord function gives us:

    45 01      swap upper and lower bytes of A
               OR move upper byte of A to lower byte of A

It also confirms the there are two Accumulators theory.

One remaining mystery is the 07 26 10 sequence that WriteHex uses to
start the shift sequence. 07 might be clear carry, and then 26 10 is arithmetic shift right

....

Fleshed out the comments/labels in Bootstrap some more. Found "or A, B" and narrowed down
some more branch instructions.

### DMA

I also think I understand DMA now. It's super cool and innovative.

It's not an MMIO device. you don't configure it with MMIO register writes.
It's not really a device at all.
The CPU is the DMA. The code simply puts the arguments for source address and destinatio
(and size?, and mode?) into the CPU's index registers. Then the code tells the device to start
a transfer and then loops checking the device's status register.
When it's ready, the device (ie Hawk Disk drive) sends a signal to the CPU board, the CPU halts
execution of the code, and switches to a microcoded copy loop that's significantly faster for copying
code. When the transfer finishes, regular code execution resumes. It sees the device status register
has changed and it knows the DMA has finished.

If I was to speculate how this functionality might interact with the multiple interrupt level register
sets, it's possible that the DMA control cable from the device includes 4 bits to control what
interrupt level the DMA transfer belongs to.
If so, you would be able issue a long-running IO operation request from one "process", switch to a
completely different process and the incoming DMA trigger from the device would trigger the CPU
 to switch to the right register set during the transfer.
The DMA transfer could be be slow, only stealing a few cycles from the foreground process until
 it completes.
There could be multiple outstanding DMA transfers in parallel. Very useful for a multi-user system.

Though, I'm just speculating here.

## Day 4

Spent a lot of time on Improving the Bootcode and F1 disasembly.

Major breakthrough of the day was working out where the DIAG MMIO was mapped.
Previously I thought it was at address 0xb800-0xbfff, But turns out that's DIAG's onboard DRAM.

DIAG MMIO is mapped to 0xf100-0xf11f

f100-f10f toggle several lines on and off. A0 controls on or off, A1, A2, A3 select which line to toggle.
The first 3 lines are connected to empty sockets, so don't do anything on our DIAG board

Which results in this memory map:

f106 - Unblank Hex Displays
f107 - Blank Hex Displays
f108 - Decimal Point 1 Set
f109 - Decimal Point 1 Clear
f10a - Decimal Point 2 Set
f10b - Decimal Point 2 Clear
f10c - Decimal Point 3 Set
f10d - Decimal Point 3 Clear
f10e - Decimal Point 4 Set
f10f - Decimal Point 4 Clear

And then both the DIP switches and Hex Displays are mapped to 0xf110 (maybe mirrored upto 0xf11f ?)

Read from 0xf110 to get the DIP switch value, Write to 0xf110 to set the hex Displays.

This makes the DiagROMs make a lot more sense.
